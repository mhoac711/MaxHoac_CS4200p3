This is a program that places the user and a computer against each other in a 4-in-a-line game where alpha-beta pruning is used to
determine the computer's move.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How to use the code:
1. Open the src folder in a designated java IDE 
2. Run the FourInALine.java file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What to expect:
1. The code will prompt the user if they would like to go first in the game.
2. The code will prompt the user to determine how long the computer will be able to think about their move.
3. Once all inputs are entered, the 4-in-a-line game will start where each player will interchange moves.
4. The game will continue until either player gets four in a row horizontally or vertically or until all the spaces of the board are filled up.
